  <h1> My Top 3 Hobbies </h1>
<li> Video Games </li>
<li> Watching Movies </li>
<li> Doing School Work </li>
<p> Playing video games is one of my favorite things to do, i play all kinda of games like World of Warships and League of Legends. The computer i play on is a desktop computer that is in my basement. I also play Fortnite from time to time but not often, i like to play survival games and building games when i can but not many are good games or completed games. My favorite game to play is Civilization 5, it is a game where you need to build your own civilization and try not to get conquered by other civilizations.

<p> Another one of my hobbies is to watch movies. I usually watch movies when im not playing video games. My favorite movie genre is Science Fiction because it reall widens the imagination and has a very creative nature to it which i like. My favorite movie is Interstellar, which is about a father who leaves a dying Earth to try and find a new home among the stars but along the way he finds the key to moving the entire population of Earth to the stars.

<p> My last hobbie is school work which is my least favorite hobby for obvious reasons. I usually do Pre-Calculus homework which we get every night and can be alot of questions. I also write alot of my essays and paper at home, like my Culture Paper for English class. I also love to complete code.org leasons and codeacademy.org leasons at home!
